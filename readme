Hallo,
this is my clone from Librecad 2, with some additions and changes.
In the main it is for CNC milling programmers (therewith i get my money).
Some differences to original LC2:

- see menu point "additional preferences"

- you can switch off native file dialog (e.g. KDE): it's important if you have mounted big directories over NFS.
  otherwise you don't need it.
  
- you can adapt number of recent files and sorting order  

- smaller grid steps switchable: 1-2-5  // 1-10-100

- try out "SnapDK": i have written my own snapper, it is mostly adaptable on your personal preferences
  i mean, the snapper is the most important tool in a CAD programm, it is VERY often used.
  
  - snapCenter now occurs when mouse is near the contour, and also near center point, when button
    "snapCenter only when near contour" is not checked. read more in the sources (entitycontainer)
     
  - you can choose between some single snapModes, only ONE at the same time is possible! (sorry, but i don't 
    like the snapper in LC2), and "snapAuto".
    
  - in "snapAuto" you can define what snapModes are active. Only the precedence is hard-coded and not in SETTINGS.
    
  - in "snapAuto" you will see different cursor forms, depending on the snap mode
  
  - "autoSnapTolerance" works like "snapRange", but only for autoSnap
    
  - snap happens on atomic entities, or on containers, if you have checked the left-side buttons in snap menubar.
  
  - "snapRange" limits the effected area, outside you have snapFree 
  
  - set "snapRange" = 0 and it is deactivated.
  
  - "snap intersection manually" is now resurfaced (someone has removed it in LC, but i often need it)
  
- in menu "modify" i added "move absolute zero" (i need it very often)

- in menu "dimensions" i added "ordinate dimension" (it is not perfect, but it works for me)

- in "draw arc tangential" i added "endpoint"

- in menu "select" i added 9 new modes, some of them specially for bore hole patterns,

- "select circle": works alike "select window", but is round

- some keyboard shortcuts added: "hh" toggles horizontal restriction, "vv" toggles vertical restriction
  "sx" and "sy" for snap modes, "mz" move absolute zero
  
- new menu "CAM" with some plugins

- needed additions to plugin-interface in main code

- a postprocessor who produces "heidenhain dialog language", a very good alternative to G-code

- for the "oldtimers" (alike myself) i converted the old qcad-icons for use together with new LC2-icons
  (rename librecad/res or make a symbolic link)
  
- in dialog-boxes for lines, arc and circles i've added some fields for output, so i can simply copy lines 
   with mouse into my growing CNC program
   
for all details, try a "grep -rn '++++++' . " - it shows you (i hope all) modified parts of code

that all is not complete, many problems are waiting for solutions, but i'm working everyday with this CAD program

some known bugs:

  trim 2 arcs together often fails because of a small difference between floating point numbers.
  has anybody an idea for a solution ? It is an old and very annoying problem

  trim 2 arcs together: i added an "if(0)" around the LC2-code, because it is currently buggy
  
  "selectIntersection" sometimes fails since big modifications in LC2, but i don't want to downgrade, it is too 
   complex. (see last items on sourceforge)
   
  print Preview : here is some work to do, but it is not very important for me
  
  DXF import :  can we consider ISOCPEUR ? i found "isocpeur.ttf" in a file, i think from "inventor" ?
  
  RS_Arc::getNearestPointOnEntity(..) is buggy: it stores a wrong value in *dist (in LC2 this value is not
  meaningful, but we should repair it)
  
  RS_EntityContainer::nextEntity(...)
     case RS2::ResolveAllButTexts: {
        we have to decrement "entIdx" if we go into a subContainer (see case RS2::ResolveAll)
	
     "case RS2::ResolveAllForSnap:" i hope it has no bugs, this code is very new
     
 Good luck! I wish you success with this program. Use it on your own risk!
 
 Dietmar
